#Algorithms and Data Structures

This directory will contain code for common algorithms.

We'll have these types of algorithms and data structures.:

| **Data Structure** | **Algorithms** | **Concept** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linked Lists | Breadth First Search | Bit Manipulation |
| Binary Trees | Depth First Search | Singleton Design Pattern | 
| Tries | Binary Search | Factory Design Pattern |
| Stacks | Merge Sort | Memory (Stack vs. Heap) | 
| Queues | Quick Sort | Recursion | 
| Vectors/Array Lists | Tree Insert Find | Big-O Time |
| Hash Tables | |
